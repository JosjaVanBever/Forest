ALL IRREPS ARE NUMBERED USING THE PSI4 iRREP CONVENTIONS!


# different active spaces:
-> .txt = a chemps2 input when using the original FCIDUMP
-> .<sym>.txt = a chemps2 input when the FCIDUMP is
                 filtered using the corresponding orborder
-> .D2h.orborder = filter for the FCIDUMP, based on D2h irrep
               bonding and anti-bonding
-> .Oh.orbordered = filter for the FCIDUMP, based on Oh irreps
# remark: Oh and D2h based files might choose different active spaces!


# based on non-relativistic, respects dkh too
12act = type0 = act0 => 12 active orbitals, D2h irrep ordered
18act => 18 active orbitals, D2h irrep ordered

# based on non-relativistic, splits Oh irreps in dkh
33act.D2h = type2 = act2 => 33 active orbitals, D2h irrep ordered

# based on scalar relativistic calculations
33act.Oh => 33 active orbitals, Oh irrep & (anti-)bonding ordered
39act => 39 active orbitals, D2h irrep & (anti-)bonding ordered
59act => 59 active orbitals, D2h irrep & (anti-)bonding ordered
